Moon lander remake on Python. This is a 2d game that expanded on my knowledge from my first experiment on .NET to make some sort of platformer. I used this game as an assignment project for CS1527 Object Oriented Programming.

The rules of the game are roughly the same ones as in Moon Lander.

There's landing pads, meteors, obstacles and the actual lander itself.

- Pads are to be landed on to proceed to the next level at a degree close to 90 (nose pointing upwards).
- Meteors will randomly occur vary in size, speed and direction, they damage the lander for 25% of its health and could damage parts so that they are inoperable. (left wing, thrusters, right wing).
- Obstacles are static objects in space that once collided with will damage the ship.
- Lander is controlled with left, up and right arrow keys where the left and right keys are for rotation and up is for using the lander's thrusters.
